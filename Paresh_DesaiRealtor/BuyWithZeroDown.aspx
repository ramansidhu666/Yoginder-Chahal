          <h2>What is Buy House With Zero Down Payment Program?</h2>
                <p>A new home ownership program allows qualified buyers to buy a home with a zero or very low down payment.</p>
          <h2>How to Buy House With Zero Down Payment?</h2>
          <p>You may have owned a home before and are presently renting, or maybe you are a first time homebuyer and need a way to break into the housing market, but held back because you thought you required $10,000, $20,000 or even more for a down payment. <br />
              Well, regardless of your present situation, if you want to get into or re-enter the housing market with a lower amount, or even without a cash down payment at all, then this new program may be just what you're looking for.
          </p>
          <h2>Why pay your landlord's mortgage when you can be building your own equity?</h2>
          <p>It is a Catch-22 situation. You cannot buy a home because you don't have enough down payment ; You don't have enough down payment because you have to pay a big part of your income in rent.  If you are currently renting and trying to accumulate enough down payment, you have two options:</p>
          <p>•	Keep paying your Landlord's mortgage, by paying rent while trying to save the required down payment
              <br />
              OR
              <br />
              •	Buy your home using this program and start building your equity now.
          </p>
