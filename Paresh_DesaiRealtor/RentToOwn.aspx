- You submit your information to us<br />
- We would analyze your situation and present your case to one of our many investor clients<br />
- Once approved by the investor, you work with one of our experienced Realtors to find the house of your dreams and within your budget<br />
- We would negotiate the price for the home and have the home purchased by our investor client<br />
- You will sign a Rent To Own agreement and a Standard Lease Agreement(Ontario) with the investor client<br />
- You will move into your home and start to pay the rent and start to save for the down payment of your home purchase at the end of the term<br />
- At the end of the term, the title of the home is transferred to your name and you become the legal owner<br />
